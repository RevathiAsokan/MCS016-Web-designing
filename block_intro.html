	<H5> BASICS OF HTML </H5>
	Web pages or materials in the form of hypermedia documents accessed through the Internet can be 
	located anywhere in the world
	</p>
	<p>
	No matter where they originated, most Web documents are created using Hypertext Markup Language(HTML).
	HTML is a powerful authoring language and has different versions like HTML 4.2/4.0/3.2/3.0 and HTML 2.
	</p>
	<p>
	HTML is used to define document structure and format, with the help of a single tag or a pair of tags.
	A tag is a string in the language surrounded by a less than and a greater than sign. An opening tag does not begin
	with a slash. An ending or closing tag is a string that begins with a slash.
	</p>
	<p>
	HTML documents format textual information with embedded markup tags that provide style and structure
	information. A whole document in HTML begins with <HTML> and ends with </HTML>.
